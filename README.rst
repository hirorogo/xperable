xperable - Xperia ABL fastboot Exploit
======================================

The xperable tool is an exploit leveraging CVE-2021-1931 Android Boot Loader
vulnerability of fastboot usb interface on Sony Yoshino and Tama platforms,
based on Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (MSM8998) and SDM845 chipsets.
That includes Sony Xperia XZ Premium, Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact mobile
phones with many region specific models for Yoshino platform.
And Sony Xperia XZ2 / XZ2 Compact / XZ2 Premium / XZ3 with region specific
models for Tama platform.

The exploit achieves arbitrary code execution in fastboot providing arbitrary
memory access via fastboot usb interface to non-secure world RAM regions
in Qualcomm Secondary Bootloader, i.e. XBL (eXtensible Boot Loader) with ABL
(Android Boot Loader), including ability to write to read-only sections.


Features
--------

Currently working features:

- bootloader unlock without Sony unlock code even for devices with bootloader
  *unlock not allowed*, like the Japanese models
- re-lock bootloader to get back into original stock firmware state
- unlock/re-lock this way does not erase Sony DRM device key
- fastboot boot of not signed kernel in bootloader locked state (Tama is wip)
- flexible command line options for experimenting with bootloader runtime
  patching that can be scripted

Android userdata erase is also skipped with unlock/re-lock, but that seems not
to be that useful as the data is not accessible most likely because decryption
fails due to flipped bootloader unlock status - android does not boot, needing
the erase.

Still it is possible for example to do an unlock, boot any android recovery
kernel via ‘fastboot boot’ from usb and then re-lock BL back with following
android boot working with the original userdata content.

Possibility to boot not signed kernel in bootloader locked state from fastboot
can allow for example to boot a rooted stock kernel or boot android recovery
kernel with userdata access after authentication for decryption or even boot
full custom ROM with locked BL.


Limitations
-----------

Using the exploit to re-lock bootloader would not magically restore Sony
DRM device key, i.e. DRM protected functionality would not work with stock
firmware even after bootloader re-lock if the key had been already lost.

Hardware based attestation will get working with stock firmware after re-lock
only if ``persist`` partition is still intact, i.e. it did not get accidentaly
flashed with it's "empty" content from Sony stock firmware, loosing the attest
key this way.


Compilation
-----------

The xperable tool is primarily designed for Linux but it can be compiled for
Windows too. It depends on libusb-1.0 and uses `pe-parse`_ library which comes
as a git submodule with this project.

.. _pe-parse: https://github.com/trailofbits/pe-parse

Clone this repository recursively

::

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/j4nn/xperable.git

and use ``make`` to build the tool in Linux. You also need ``cmake`` which
is called from this project's Makefile to build pe-parse library.

The Makefile contains additional targets for cross compilation that can be
selected via ``CROSS_BUILD`` variable setting on make command line, expecting
a cross compilation toolchain as specified in the Makefile.

The exploit needs yoshino LinuxLoader UEFI module as fastboot runtime patch
base. It can be exctracted from ABL of Sony stock firmware bootloader -
`uefi-firmware-parser`_ tool is needed for this. Exctraction is invoked
from the Makefile if needed, reporting what stock firmware files to get
and where to place them.

.. _uefi-firmware-parser: https://github.com/theopolis/uefi-firmware-parser


Yoshino Device Setup
--------------------

The exploit is targetting ``LA2_0_P_114`` bootloader, but it needs XFL
from ``LA1_1_O_77`` version in order to work. While XFL is not directly
used in fastboot mode, ABL customized by Sony verifies XFL integrity
for some reason, influencing bootloader memory layout.
XFL is a linux kernel that provides Sony flash mode (green LED light)
functionality for flashing stock firmware files.

With any newer XFL version the exploit is not able to overflow fastboot
usb buffer into ABL code region, most likely because of bigger XFL size
in all newer bootloader versions. Therefore you need to flash the old XFL
manually from a root shell via dd command to ``xfl`` partition.

In case bootloader is still locked, you can get a temporal root shell using
`bindershell`_ exploit available for Sony stock Android Oreo firmware.
If running a newer firmware, downgrade would be needed requiring userdata
erase, so you may need to backup the phone first.
Please check what firmware versions are supported by bindershell `here`_.

.. _bindershell: https://github.com/j4nn/renoshell/tree/CVE-2019-2215
.. _here: https://github.com/j4nn/renoshell/blob/CVE-2019-2215/jni/offsets.c#L36

After making sure you can get a root shell, flash the ``LA2_0_P_114``
bootloader version using only the ``boot`` subdirectory of the latest
stock firmware available for your phone skipping flash of everything else.

Prepare the old XFL image using ``make boot/xfl-o77.mbn`` command
in this project's directory, following shown instructions to get
required files if missing.

Upload the ``boot/xfl-o77.mbn`` file to the phone using adb or sdcard
and use following command in a root shell to flash it to xfl partition:

::

  # dd if=/sdcard/xfl-o77.mbn of=/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/xfl

You may need to adjust the location of xfl-o77.mbn in the ``if=`` option
depending on where the file has been copied to. It may be also safer
to use ``sync`` command in addition before rebooting the phone.


Tama Device Setup
-----------------

The exploit is targetting ``LA2_0_P_118`` bootloader of XZ2 / XZ3 devices.
This version of bootloader is present in the newest stock firmware versions
of Japan specific models.

International Tama devices have newer version of bootloader in the latest
firmware versions, so you may need to downgrade in order to use the exploit.
Flash only the ``boot`` subdirectory of 52.0.A.8.50 stock fw version skipping
flash of everything else.


Command Line Options
--------------------

The xperable tool interprets command line options shown bellow, immediately
executing each of them as they appear, allowing to craft bootloader runtime
patching scripts.

    :             'patchseq' hex values are byte values
    /             'patchseq' hex values are 32 bit values
    %             'patchseq' hex values are 32 bit to be byte swapped
    @             'patchseq' hex values are 64 bit values


Usage Examples
--------------

It may be possible to use defaults preset in the exploit when testing
with **Xperia XZ1 Compact (G8441)**, like this:

::

  $ ./xperable -B -U -4

  [+] LinuxLoader @ 0x98dc0000 patched successfully (usb buff @ 0x97e85000, distance = 0x00f3b000)

  $ ./xperable -l | grep -w 'BOOT\|XBOOT\|Build'
  [+] Print log buffer, logbuf_pos = 0x0000, length = 0x24ca:
  UEFI Ver    : 4.2.190723.BOOT.XF.1.2.2.c1-00023-M8998LZB-1.209796.1

  XBOOT (1306-5035_X_Boot_MSM8998_LA2.0_P_114)
  Fastboot Build Info: Jul 23 2019 16:47:34

With the above ``-4`` done succesfully bootloader can be unlocked (aka Y)
or re-locked (aka X) in following way:

::

  $ ./xperable -c "oem unlock Y" -1 -c reboot -1
  [+] Starting test1 size = 0xffffffff, offset = 0xffffffff, cmd = 'oem unlock Y'
  [+] Starting test1 size = 0xffffffff, offset = 0xffffffff, cmd = 'reboot'

  $ ./xperable -c "oem unlock X" -1 -c reboot -1
  [+] Starting test1 size = 0xffffffff, offset = 0xffffffff, cmd = 'oem unlock X'
  [+] Starting test1 size = 0xffffffff, offset = 0xffffffff, cmd = 'reboot'

Following examples show testing with **Xperia XZ1 Dual SIM (G8342)**.
Test if we can get fastboot code execution with usb buffer overflow
into an infinite loop fully hanging fastboot.

Not responding to ``reboot-bootloader`` fastboot command most likely confirms
hanging code execution. Force reboot by holding power with Vol+ buttons together,
then holding only Vol+ in order to boot back into fastboot.

Now try to find a working buffer overflow size with test case ``-2``.
Binary seach may be used in order to narrow down the range.

Not signed android kernel booted in bootloader locked state. The above patch
to allow ``fastboot boot`` in bootloader locked state is already integrated
in the exploit - it can be enabled by ``-x`` option used within the ``-4`` run.
The patch of VerifiedBootDxe to skip image signature verification is implemented
with ``-6`` test case. Not signed kernel can be booted from fastboot right after
that:

::

  $ ./xperable -c reboot-bootloader -1
  [+] Starting test1 size = 0xffffffff, offset = 0xffffffff, cmd = 'reboot-bootloader'

  $ ./xperable -B -U -s 0xf49880 -x -4 -6

  [+] Starting test1 size = 0x025f4000, offset = 0xffffffff, cmd = 'boot'



It may be possible to use defaults preset in the exploit when testing
with **Xperia XZ2 (H8266)**, like this:

::

  $ ./xperable -B -U -5
  version-bootloader: 1310-7079_X_Boot_SDM845_LA2.0_P_118
  [+] Starting test5 size = 0x400f90, offset = 0x2a7000, payloadsize = 0xfb000

  $ ./xperable -l | grep -w 'BOOT\|XBOOT\|Build'
  [+] Print log buffer, logbuf_pos = 0x0000, length = 0x3354:
  S - QC_IMAGE_VERSION_STRING=BOOT.XF.2.0-00364-SDM845LZB-1

With the above ``-5`` done succesfully bootloader can be unlocked (aka Y)
or re-locked (aka X) in the following way:

::

  $ ./xperable -c "oem unlock Y" -1 -c reboot -1
  [+] Starting test1 size = 0xffffffff, offset = 0xffffffff, cmd = 'oem unlock Y'
  Device already unlocked
  [+] Starting test1 size = 0xffffffff, offset = 0xffffffff, cmd = 'reboot'

With XZ2 already unlocked the default exploit setup no longer works, it seems
memory layout is randomized differently. So we need to find new hit offset
range if we like to re-lock bootloader back.

::

With fastboot hanging like above, the code execution is most likely confirmed.
Now try to find a working buffer overflow size with test case ``-3``.
Binary search may be used in order to narrow down the range.

::

  $ ./xperable -B -U -s 0xb00f90 -3
  version-bootloader: 1310-7079_X_Boot_SDM845_LA2.0_P_118
  [+] Starting test3 size = 0xb00f90, offset = 0x2a7000, cmd = 'download:00000010'
  [+] test3 not hit: response = ''

Not enough overflow size, try a bigger one next.

and bootloader had been re-locked:

Trying to boot twrp with locked xz2 fails most of the time so far as exploited
fastboot state seems not to be stable enough or there may be a bug or something
still missing that needs to be implemented, so this is still work in progress.
But there has been eventually one case in which twrp booted successfully.

Linux Host Setup
----------------

The exploit may need to use big usb transfers, like 16MB or more. This is most
likely not supported by default, so kernel of your linux distro may need to be
patched and recompiled in order to support allocation of big usb buffers.
Without the kernel patch errors like

::

  [!] libusb_bulk_transfer failed: Insufficient memory ep=0x01 len=0xfff800 size=0xfff800
  [!] fbusb_bufcmd send failed: reqsz=0xfff800 res=0xffffffff

may be shown from running the exploit.

There is ``misc/host-linux-kernel-x86-support-big-usb-transfers.patch``
included with this project for reference how to patch the kernel.

Following kernel command line option is needed in addition to enable
big usb transfers:

::

  usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=0

Alternatively you may try ``-b maxsize`` command line option of the exploit
to use smaller transfer chunks, but it may cause the exploit to fail entirely.


Windows Host Setup
------------------

In order to use the exploit from Windows, you may need to install a fastboot
driver for your phone in order to access it in fastboot mode.

The usage is the same as with the examples from linux above, just make sure
to use double quotes for commands containing a space, like ``"oem unlock"``.


Usage from Another Phone
------------------------

It is possible to connect two android phones via USB-C adapter (and a powered
USB HUB) and run the exploit from a root shell on one phone in order to exploit
the other phone - just use the ``aarch64`` cross compiled build of the tool.
The root shell of the "host" phone may come from full root or even a temp root.
